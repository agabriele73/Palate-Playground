        title='Spaghetti and Meatballs',
        protein_type='beef',
        steps='In a bowl, combine the chopped mortadella, ground beef, fennel seed, salt, garlic, parmesan cheese, black pepper, panko, and eggs, mixing well until the mixture becomes emulsified and tacky. Use a large cookie scoop to shape the mixture into around twenty meatballs, placing them on a sheet tray and rolling them into balls. Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, ensuring the bottom is covered. Once the oil is hot, add all the meatballs in a single layer and sear them for about 2 minutes on each side until they turn golden brown. It\'s alright if they are not fully cooked at this stage. Remove the meatballs from the pan and set them aside. For the sauce, reduce the heat to medium in the same pan used for the meatballs. Add the garlic and sauté for approximately five minutes, then incorporate the red pepper flakes and sauté for an additional thirty seconds. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and a pinch of sugar, and mix well. Return the meatballs to the pan, bring the sauce to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the meatballs to simmer in the sauce for about five to eight minutes, ensuring they are fully cooked. At the halfway point, add the slightly bruised basil and continue cooking. Before plating, reserve one cup of the sauce. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a pot of boiling salted water according to the instructions on the package, until it is done. It is important not to drain the pasta. To serve, place the cooked spaghetti on plates, top it with the meatballs and sauce, and drizzle the reserved sauce on top. Enjoy!',
