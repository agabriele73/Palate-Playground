        steps='In a bowl, combine the chopped mortadella, ground beef, fennel seed, salt, garlic, parmesan cheese, black pepper, panko, and eggs, mixing well until the mixture becomes emulsified and tacky. Use a large cookie scoop to shape the mixture into around twenty meatballs, placing them on a sheet tray and rolling them into balls. Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, ensuring the bottom is covered. Once the oil is hot, add all the meatballs in a single layer and sear them for about 2 minutes on each side until they turn golden brown. It\'s alright if they are not fully cooked at this stage. Remove the meatballs from the pan and set them aside. For the sauce, reduce the heat to medium in the same pan used for the meatballs. Add the garlic and sauté for approximately five minutes, then incorporate the red pepper flakes and sauté for an additional thirty seconds. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and a pinch of sugar, and mix well. Return the meatballs to the pan, bring the sauce to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the meatballs to simmer in the sauce for about five to eight minutes, ensuring they are fully cooked. At the halfway point, add the slightly bruised basil and continue cooking. Before plating, reserve one cup of the sauce. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a pot of boiling salted water according to the instructions on the package, until it is done. It is important not to drain the pasta. To serve, place the cooked spaghetti on plates, top it with the meatballs and sauce, and drizzle the reserved sauce on top. Enjoy!',

        protein_type='vegetarian',
        steps='To make this delicious fried rice, start by beating the eggs in a bowl along with a pinch of salt and sliced green onions. Set this mixture aside. Slice the green onions diagonally for added visual appeal. Next, heat a wok or skillet over high heat and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, swirling it around to coat the surface. Pour the beaten eggs into the wok and scramble them. Once the eggs are about 3/4 cooked, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of cooking oil and the cold jasmine rice. Gently break down the rice and mix it with the eggs, allowing the flavors to combine. Day-old cold jasmine rice works best as it has a wonderful aroma and fluffy texture that holds up well during frying. Now, add soy sauce around the edge of the wok, creating a slightly burnt effect for a smoky and umami flavor. Adjust the salt according to your taste preferences and mix everything thoroughly. If needed, reduce the heat to low. Finally, turn off the heat and stir in the sliced green onions, enhancing the dish with their freshness and crunch. Enjoy!',

Drain the can of diced tomatoes and combine them in a bowl with minced garlic, luscious olive oil, fragrant oregano, a pinch of salt, a melange of freshly cracked pepper (approx. 10 twists), and a spritz of invigorating lemon juice. In a generously sized casserole dish, gently disperse about a third of this tantalizing tomato concoction as the flavorful foundation. Next, carefully place the fish fillets atop this bed, ensuring they recline without crowding. A splendid encore of the tomato blend swathes the fish, cocooning them in a symphony of flavors. Let this harmonious creation bake in the preheated oven for around 15 minutes, allowing the fish to achieve an internal temperature of 145ºF and become a tapestry of easily flaked tenderness. When the culinary masterpiece emerges, delicately garnish with a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley, adding a burst of color and herbaceous delight. As the steam rises, serve this delectable ensemble piping hot, a testament to your culinary finesse that is sure to enrapture the senses and ignite a chorus of indulgence.',
